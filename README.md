A (very) short introduction to R
------

Here you'll find three documents that my colleague Paul Torfs and I wrote about learning R:

[**1. A (very) short introduction to R**](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/A%20(very)%20short%20introduction%20to%20R.pdf)

The base document, with 10 pages of background and exercises and 2 pages listing useful functions (to use as a reference).
Working through this document takes 1 to 4 hours (depending on your background).
This document can also be downloaded from the R website (as contributed document): https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf

[**2. Practising R using swirl**](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/Using%20swirl%20to%20practise%20R.pdf)

The next step after the (very) short introduction. This short manual points you to some nice classes (created by others).


[**3. Portable versions of R and RStudio**](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/Portable%20versions%20of%20R%20and%20RStudio.pdf)

In case you want to take R everywhere you go (you may want to install the programs on a USB stick in case of administrator rights issues).
