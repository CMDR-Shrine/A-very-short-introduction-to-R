A (very) short introduction to R
------

Here you'll find three documents that my colleague Paul Torfs and I wrote about learning R:

[**1. A (very) short introduction to R**](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/A%20(very)%20short%20introduction%20to%20R.pdf)

The base document, with 10 pages of background and exercises and 2 pages listing useful functions (to use as a reference).
Working through this document takes 1 to 2 hours (depending on your background).
An older version of this document can also be downloaded from the R website (as contributed document): https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf

[**2. Doing "A (very) short introduction to R" in the interactive swirl environment**](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/Doing%20A%20(very)%20short%20introduction%20to%20R%20in%20swirl.pdf)

Instead of reading the pdf and doing the ToDo exercises, you can also go through the text and exercises in an interactive environment called swirl (developed by swirlstats.com). This short manual gets you started with the (very) short introduction to R. It also points you to some nice follow-up classes created by others. 

<!--Download the swc file with the swirl course [here](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/A_(very)_short_introduction_to_R.swc).-->

This swirl course is brand new, so it may still contain errors. If you find any, let me know on the issues page. 


[**3. Portable versions of R and RStudio**](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/Portable_versions_of_R_and_RStudio.pdf)

In case you want to take R everywhere you go (you may want to install the programs on a USB stick in case of administrator rights issues).
