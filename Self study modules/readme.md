Self study modules
------

To learn R step by step, we made 8 self study modules of 1-3 hours (depending on your background): 
1. A (very) short introduction to R
2. R Programming MOOC first part 
3. R Programming MOOC second part
4. Basic plotting
5. Pretty plotting
6. Reading data files
7. Matrix operations
8. Spatial data

Modules 2 and 3 are swirl lessons belonging to the course [R Programming](www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming) (the credits go to the developers of that course). Modules 4-8 are script writing assignments.
More information can be found in the folders belonging to each module.
